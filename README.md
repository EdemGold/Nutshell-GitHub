## Introduction

GitHub is a huge resource for developers, it houses most of the code used for software development. But unfortunately, a lot of developers don't know how to use Git or GitHub especially beginners and they are unable to contribute to open source due of this gap in their knowledge.

This project was built to provide resources for developers to find all they need to understand Git and GitHub.
