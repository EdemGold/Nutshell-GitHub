> The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.

## Introduction

GitHub is a huge resource for developers, it houses most of the code used for software development. But unfortunately, a lot of developers don't know how to use Git and GitHub especially beginners and they are unable to contribute because of this gap in their knowledge.

This project was built to provide a resource for newbie developers to find all they need to understand Git and GitHub.

## Contribution guidelines
Here are the few contribution rules:

- Contribute only things related to GitHub.
- Your explanations should be easy to understand.
- If you have any information about already created .txt files then add your information to those text files.
- If any item is not included in any of the text files then feel free to create your text file.
